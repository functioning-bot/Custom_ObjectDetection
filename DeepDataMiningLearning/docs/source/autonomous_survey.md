## Introduction and SAE Autonomy Levels

The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has established a widely accepted standard for defining levels of driving automation. The SAE J3016 standard defines six levels of driving automation, from Level 0 (no automation) to Level 5 (full automation).

![SAE J3016 Levels of Driving Automation](https://www.sae.org/binaries/content/gallery/cm/content/news/sae-blog/j3016graphic_2021.png)

### SAE Level Definitions

**Level 2 (Partial Automation)**: Vehicle can control both steering and acceleration/deceleration simultaneously, but human driver must remain engaged and monitor the driving environment at all times.

**Level 3 (Conditional Automation)**: Vehicle can perform all driving tasks under specific conditions, but human driver must be ready to take control when requested <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot" index="1">1</mcreference>.

**Level 4 (High Automation)**: Systems can handle all driving tasks within their operational design domain without human intervention <mcreference link="https://www.wired.com/story/chinas-best-self-driving-car-platforms-tested-and-compared-xpeng-nio-li-auto/" index="2">2</mcreference>.

**Level 5 (Full Automation)**: Complete autonomy under all conditions that a human driver could handle. **No current system has achieved SAE Level 5** <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot" index="1">1</mcreference>.
