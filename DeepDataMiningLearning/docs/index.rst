   This project is under active development.

If you find the tutorials helpful and would like to cite them, you can use the following bibtex::

There are three main ways of running the notebooks we recommend:

- **Local Machine**: You can download our sample code from `Github <https://github.com/lkk688/DeepDataMiningLearning/tree/main>`_. Following the following sections to setup your local AI system (choose the Machine type, CPU or GPU version depending on your system).

- **Google Colab**: If you prefer to run the code on a different platform than your own computer, or want to experiment with GPU support, we recommend using `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true>`_. Each notebook on this documentation website has a badge with a link to open it on Google Colab. Remember to enable GPU support before running the notebook (:code:`Runtime -> Change runtime type`). If using Colab, changes will  be lost after timeout or when closed your session. You need to manually save the data to your local computer or your Google Drive.

- **SJSU CoE HPC**: If you want to save your large dataset and train your own (larger) neural networks for a longer period (longer than Colab's timeout), you can make use of our SJSU CoE HPC cluster. The setup of your HPC workspace is documented beblow in the HPC section.
